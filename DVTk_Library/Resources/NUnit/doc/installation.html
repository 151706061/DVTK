<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>By default the <b>NUnit</b> installation program places all of the files into the 
	<b>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NUnit&nbsp;2.4.8</b> directory. In the installation directory 
	there are three sub-directories: bin, doc, and samples. Source code is no
      longer provided with the binary installation package. Download the source
	  package if source is needed.
<h3>Running NUnit</h3>
<p>The installation program places a number of items in the Start menu. There are
	a number of shortcuts, which run the NUnit GUI under various versions of .NET
	or under Mono, depending on the versions available on your system at the time
	of installation.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>When running NUnit from the command line or through the desktop shortcut, the
	configuration files files nunit.exe.config and nunit-console.exe.config control 
	which version of the CLR is used. As installed, the <startup> section of the
	config file is commented out and may be left that way unless problems arise.
	If uncommented, the order of precedence is .NET 2.0, .NET 1.1 and .NET 1.0. 
	To change which version is used, simply change the order of the elements
	in the config files. The nunit About Box shows the version currently being used.</p>
<p>Settings that you place in these files are not available to your tests or to the 
	production code you are testing. A separate config file is used when running 
	tests. If you are running tests from the test.dll assembly, the config file 
	should be named test.dll.config. If you are running tests from the NUnit test 
	project MyTests.nunit, the config file should be named MyTests.config. In 
	either case the config file must reside in the same directory as the file from 
	which it takes its name.</p>
<p>In addition to settings of your own, the config file for a set of tests may 
	contain information used by NUnit in loading your tests. In particular, this 
	allows you to control the apartment state and priority of the thread that NUnit 
	uses to run your tests. Other settings may be added in the future. See the file 
	nunit.tests.dll for an example.</p>
<h3>Installation Verification</h3>
<p>Verify that the installation has worked successfully by running the NUnit gui and
loading and running NUnitTests.nunit in the bin directory. All tests should pass.

<p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Although the NUnit installation has been modified to allow non-admin
    users to install, there are still a large number of tests which can only run
	successfully under an administrative id. This is a problem with the code in
	the tests themselves, not with NUnit.</p>
<h3>Timing Tests</h3>
<p>The assembly timing-tests.dll contains several tests that measure the performance of
    NUnit in loading tests. In addition, it contains some long-running tests that are used 
	to verify that all remoting timeout problems have been fixed. The test cases 
	all run for six to 12 minutes and give no indication whatsoever that they are 
	working! This is required since correct handling of a non-communicative user 
	test is what these tests are all about.</p>
<h3>Additional Tests</h3>
<p>Additional tests are included with the samples and in separate assemblies used 
	as data by the verification tests themselves. Failures or not run conditions in 
	these tests are intentional.</p>
<h3>Manual Installation</h3>
<p>If you are building NUnit from source, it is recommended that you use the
    NAnt script for your final build, since it puts all the required files
	into one directory, from which you can easily copy them. Perform a manual
	installation by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<p><li>Copy the following files to the target directory:
			<ul>
				<li>nunit.framework.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.framework.extensions.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.core.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.core.interfaces.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.core.extensions.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.mocks.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.uikit.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.util.dll</li>
				<li>nunit-console-runner.dll</li>
				<li>nunit-console.exe</li>
				<li>nunit-console.exe.config</li>
				<li>nunit-gui-runner.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.exe</li>
				<li>nunit.exe.config</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	<p><li>Create shortcuts as needed.</li>
	<p><li>If you want to be able to run the nunit tests, copy the following files to the 
			same location as the others, along with any additional config files
			for the dlls.
			<ul>
				<li>mock-assembly.dll</li>
				<li>nonamespace-assembly.dll</li>
				<li>notestfixtures-assembly.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.core.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.extensions.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.framework.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.mocks.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.uikit.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.util.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit-console.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit-gui.tests.dll</li>
				<li>nunit.testutilities.dll</li>
				<li>test-assembly.dll</li>
				<li>timing-tests.dll</li>
				<li>NunitTests.nunit</li>
				<li>NUnitTests.config</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
</ol>

<h4>Installation Under Mono</h4>

<p>Mono is delivered with a version of NUnit already pre-installed. The Mono 1.0 release 
	included a beta version of NUnit 2.2. Later builds may include a more up-to-date 
	version of NUnit. Before attempting to install NUnit under Mono, determine whether 
	an equivalent or newer version is already installed. It may be necessary to remove 
	the pre-installed version from the GAC in order for the new version to be recognized.</p>
