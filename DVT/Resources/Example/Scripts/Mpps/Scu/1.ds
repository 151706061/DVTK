## SCU MPPS DICOMScript: 1.ds
##
## Pre-conditions:
##      - no association
##
## Test Scenario:
##      - send association for Modality Performed Procedure Step Service Class
##              - little endian implicit VR
##      - expect accept association - Result/Reason = 0 - success
##	- send N-CREATE-RQ Modality Performed Procedure Step - "IN PROGRESS"
##	- expect N-CREATE-RSP - status = 0000 (success)
##	- send association release request
##	- expect association release response
##
## Expected Result:
##      - SCU signals MPPS "IN PROGRESS"
##
## Post-conditions:
##      - no association
