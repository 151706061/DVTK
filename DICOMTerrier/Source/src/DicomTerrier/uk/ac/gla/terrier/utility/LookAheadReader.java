/**
 * Implements a Reader, that encapsulates another stream, but only upto the
 * point that a pre-defined end marker in the stream is identified. The Reader
 * will then become endOfFile, and refuse to return any more characters from the
 * stream. Suppose that we create an instance of a LookAheadReader with the 
 * end marker END. For the following input:
 * <tt>a b c d END e f g...</tt>
 * the LookAheadReader will stop after reading the string END. Note that the 
 * end marker will be missing from the parent stream.
