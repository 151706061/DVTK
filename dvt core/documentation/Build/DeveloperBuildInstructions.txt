Developer Build Instructions

These instructions guide the build of the DVTK component, subcomponents and library modules.

The DVTK system consists of:
Class Library       C#                                  DVTK
Class Library       C#                                  DvtkData
Dynamic Library     C++ Managed Extensions  Mixed-Mode  DVTKManagedCodeAdapter
Various Static Libs C++

Dependencies:
DVTK                    ->  DvtkData, DVTKManagedCodeAdapter
DvtkManagedCodeAdapter  ->  DvtkData, Various Static Libraries
DvtkData                ->  None

Important:
Visual Studio 2003 has a (bug) problem when switching between build configurations <Debug|Release>.
The build dependency between DvtkManagedCodeAdapter and DvtkData is not correctly updated.
This may result in incorrect builds.

Work around:
This work around ensures that VS finds the correct dependencies during restart of VS.
Either;
    1)
    Ensure deletion of all binaries of the old configuration. 
    Binaries in bin, release and debug directories of DvtkData, DvtkManagedCodeAdapter and DVTK.
    or;
    2)
    Build solution in new configuration. Then close VS. Restart VS. And build again.

FIX: The bool Type Does Not Marshal Correctly from Unmanaged Code
A VS patch is required to fix this bug. Needed to correctly build the DVTKManagedCodeAdapter!

The proper CRT (C-runtime) and MFC needs to be used with the DVTK component.

DVT currently makes use of redistributable dlls;
    DVTK depends on redistributable dlls;
        MFC71.dll
        MSVCP71.dll
        MSVCR71.dll
    DVT depends on redistributable dlls;
        AxInterop.SHDocVw.dll
        Interop.SHDocVw.dll

Good luck building the projects.
